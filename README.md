Hungry but can't decide on what to eat? Introducing the Android app "Kai pan", a marwari phrase for "anything" essentially suggests items at random with a feature for you to add in your preference. 

You may add filters or preferences for choice of cuisine or type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). I started this out in 2014 and will try to pick up on it sometime soon. Keeping the code here for my own reference and if anybody would like to see it. Application uses xml formatting for the layout and a database structure for all the recipes stored.
